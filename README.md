### building functionality for calendar

aspects: - react-hook-form: to create an event - react-modal: to contain the form - fullcalendar: for calendar functionality

### current progress:

    - bootstrapped the react version for fullcalendar
    - built the modal with react-modal and made the activation on event creation event
    - built a static version of the form

### up next:

    - creating a state management solution
    current structure ( parent (Calendar) -> child (Modal) -> grandchild (Form) )
    - implementing the dynamic version of the form
    - creating the delete functionality
    - discuss the edit functionality?
